# Earthsong VSCode Theme

This is a VSCode theme for personal use based on the Earthsong TextMate colors. I really enjoy the overall color scheme of Earthsong, however, I wanted to tweak it a bit more to my liking. This is the result.

I'll finish the documentation another time when I put the final touches on everything.
